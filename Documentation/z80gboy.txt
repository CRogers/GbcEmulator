I was just reading your Z80 homepage, and I noticed that you wanted more
details about the Gameboy CPU. I have a little bit of information that I
thought you might like.

The CPU is a Z80 workalike running at 4.19 MHz. The CPU has several
registers missing and some instructions changes. These are as follows:

* The "shadow" set of registers [BC',DE',HL',AF'] and the index registers
  [IX,IY] are missing and, consequently, there are no DD and FD opcode
tables.

* The I/O ports are gone and so are all IN/OUT opcodes.

* HALT is interrupted even when interrupts are disabled.

* Following Z80 opcodes are changed:
